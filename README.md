--> Task-1.py                                                                                                                                         
This Python File Scan's the given collection of documents and filters the url's for txt files in a compressed txt folder.                                                  
Step-1 -> To run the Task-1.py you need to install internet-archive's python library. Ex - pip install internetarchive.                                                 
Step-2 -> We need to give the collection_id or collection_name of the collection of democracy's library for getting txt urls for the same.                        
Step-3 -> There are two scripts one without progress file which will restart if crashed but is faster and other which tracks the progress with collection_id and count of URL's           which will continue without any argument by taking the collection_id from the progress file.
